# FocusMode

Turns off the visibility for several objects in principal menu.

I would like to change the implementation of some functions, but right now this works well.

TO-DO:

- [ ] Add CreatorLayer to hide buttons, except creator, search and saved
- [ ] Add boolean configs to hide or show buttons like Settings, Geode, or profile, etc.
- [ ] Handle the getChildByID better.
- [ ] Handle the setVisible() better.
